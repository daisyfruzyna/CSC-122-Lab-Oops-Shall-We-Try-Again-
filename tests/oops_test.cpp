// In most labs, you are required to write unit tests as well as a driver program.
// However, we have not learned how to test an infinite while loop with unit tests.
// It is possible to do, but you need to carefully handle the user input and validation.
// Thus, for this lab, you do NOT need to write any unit tests via Catch2.
// You only need to write a driver program that tests your function.
